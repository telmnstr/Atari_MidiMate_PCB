# Atari_midimate_PCB
Atari "MidiMate" compat PCB in a direct-plug style like the FujiNet

- Based on sio2midi at https://ataribits.weebly.com/midi.html
- Different form factor for plugging straight into system with SIO on rear
- out/in cables pass through machines for linking MidiMaze

This is built for a one-time run of PCBs to do a 16 player MidiMaze setup at VCF using physical
midi cables. We will swap to FujiNet virtual midi network halfway through. 

Created in KiCad. I had to pull in the part for the DIN-5 from an extra library, which I included in this file.
